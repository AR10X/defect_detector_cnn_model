Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
========================================================

Technologies
------------

TensorFlow, Keras

Description
-----------

The objective of this project was to develop a deep learning model for image classification. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented and trained using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images into [insert target class]. The data was pre-processed and transformed to prepare it for model training.

Key Contributions
-----------------

-   Pre-processed and transformed [insert dataset details, size, etc.] to prepare it for model training.
-   Trained and evaluated the CNN model using accuracy and F1 score as metrics.
-   Improved the model performance by [insert metric/percentage improvement].

Metrics
-------

Accuracy, F1 Score

Results
-------

The model achieved an accuracy of [insert achieved accuracy] and F1 score of [insert achieved F1 score], outperforming [insert benchmark/previous models].
